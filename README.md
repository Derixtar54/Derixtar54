- ðŸ‘‹ I am Subham Jyoti, a final year student at Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, where I am majoring in Production Engineering. I am passionate about coding, trading, investing, and finance. I am also a big fan of 
      blockchain, Web3.0, and cryptoassets. I am always looking for ways to relate finance to my daily life, and I love to think about these topics every day.
      In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, playing badminton and cricket, and occasionally playing Battleground Mobile India (PUBG). I also love to travel to new places and meet new people.
  I am a curious and ambitious individual with a strong desire to learn and grow. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities, and I am excited to see what the future holds.
